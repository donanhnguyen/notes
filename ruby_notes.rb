hello = "hello"

class attributes
  
  attr_reader: can change attributes/variables but only within the class
  
  attr_writer: makes a change to the attribute but only outside of the class
  
  example, if you wanna do this:
  
  class Sex
  end
  #outside the class
  hey = class.new
  hey.name = "sex"
  hey.name = "balls"
  
  attr_accessor: does it all
  
  
  
  !! use this before something to see if it is not-not something.
